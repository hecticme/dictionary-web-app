#### This is a dictionary web app using free API from https://dictionaryapi.dev/
This project uses npm and is bundled with Vite [https://vitejs.dev/].

- The UI of this project comes from a challenge on Frontend Mentor: [https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL]. I don't have premium account for the design file so I try my best to replicate the interface.
- Styled with SCSS. Fetch data with Axios library.

#### Script:
- `npm run dev` to start dev server.
- `npm run build` to build the production version.
